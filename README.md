# EC6020-Smart-Agriculture-Project

## **Overview**  
The Smart Agriculture System is an IoT-enabled project designed to automate and optimize agricultural practices. The system leverages sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud integration to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real-time. It automates irrigation using a water pump controlled by a relay module, ensuring crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. Farmers can remotely monitor and control the system via a smartphone app or web dashboard, enhancing resource efficiency and productivity.

This solution is cost-effective, scalable, and capable of integrating additional sensors to expand its functionality. The system's predictive analytics feature provides actionable insights by analyzing environmental data over time, helping farmers make data-driven decisions and adapt to changing conditions.
